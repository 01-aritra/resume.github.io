    <div class="title1"> <h2>Know about JAVA. </h2> </div>
    <div class="subtit1">
      <p>Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle Corporation) in the mid-1990s. It is platform-independent, meaning that Java programs can run on any hardware or software platform that supports the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Java is commonly used for developing desktop applications, web applications, mobile applications, and games.

        Java is designed to be simple, portable, and secure. It has a rich set of APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that allow developers to easily create complex applications with minimal coding. Java's object-oriented nature makes it easier to manage large and complex codebases, and its garbage collection system automatically manages memory allocation and deallocation, reducing the likelihood of memory leaks and other memory-related errors.
        
        Java's syntax is similar to that of C++ and C#, but with additional features such as automatic memory management and built-in support for multithreading. Java code is compiled into bytecode, which can be run on any system that has a Java Virtual Machine installed. This makes Java programs highly portable and easy to distribute.
        
        Java is widely used in the enterprise and is the foundation for many popular frameworks and technologies such as Spring, Hibernate, and Apache Struts. It is also used extensively in the Android mobile operating system, which is based on the Java programming language.
